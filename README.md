<h1 align="center">JuaLang</h1> 

an experimental programming language which is written based on custom PDA style algorithm instead of algorithms like LALR(1) and etc

## Why Jua?
- the first reason is just for having fun ! :)
- well when i use compiled languages , if i want to extend my final product and let users extend it more -> i need to embed python , js or wasm but well they have so much features which is not needed and we dont want to allow the extension system have them because its so much and etc , that time Jua comes in . Jua is not general propose programming language -> its designed to be a basic language with basic functionality well its functionality is extendable as much as you need !!!

## How to use?
- Jua comes in some header files to make its static build so much easier !

## TODO!
- [x] lexer init
- [x] function calls
- [x] function return type
- [x] mixing up functions and expr
- [x] scope creation
- [ ] adding error messages 
- [x] adding expr
- [x] adding parans to expr 
- [x] supporting other keywords (while , if)
- [x] bytecode runner
- [x] JuaLang Extensions def in bytecode runner
- [ ] code optimization
