# JuaLang
an experimental programming language which is written based on PDAs instead of algorithms like LALR(1) and etc

## Goal
- creating an extension system for fun

## TODO!
- [x] lexer init
- [x] function calls
- [ ] adding expr
- [ ] supporting other keywords
- [ ] bytecode runner
- [ ] JuaLang Extensions

** for now with an bytecode runner jua can be used as config file **
